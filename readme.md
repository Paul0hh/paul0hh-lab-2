## Paul Lam
## GEOG 328 Lab 2

In this lab 2 project, I will showcase a simple responsive website built using **CSS, JS, and HTML**

This website will walk through my custom jewlery business with pages:
**About Me**
**Work I Specialize In**
**My Bespoke Portfolio**
**My Links**
**References**

This website will use responsive features such as a navigation bar, image gallery, counters, and tables. All will be doone based off of W3School code.
